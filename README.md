### Company information:
Outfront is one of the largest media and outdoor advertising companies. It helps people, places, and businesses grow stronger by providing an integrated and target platform. With that, it also owns and operates outdoor advertising displays.

### Problem statement: 
Outdoor commercial advertising is necessary for brands and international companies. It helps grab customers' attention through displaying ads. Therefore, knowing rush hours, idle times, and whether Covid-19 has an effect or not is essential to Outfront.

### Value for the company: 
Due to the nature of the subway audience, ads are seen by millions of riders multiple times a day. Therefore, it is a cost-effective option for both Outfront and businesses planning to work with them.
